  //The value goes into the variable and
  //if you change the original variable,
  // it won't update the other one.

  let name = "Josh";
  let name2 = name;
  console.log(name, name2);

  name = "Bob";
  console.log(name, name2);

  //ARRAYS

  const players = ["Wes", "Mika", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

  //make a copy of the original array
  const team = players; //it references the original array
  console.log(players, team);
  //if you update the copy, it will also change the original array.
  //it references back to it.
  team[3] = "Lux";
  console.log(players, team);

  //If you want to make a real copy and update it, do one of these things:
  let team2 = players.slice();
  let team3 = [].concat(players);
  let team4 = [...players];
  let team5 = Array.from(players);

  team2[2] = "Peter";
  console.log(players, team2);

  //OBJECTS
  person = {
    name: "Wes Bos",
    age: 80
  };

  //makes a reference to the original object
  const captain = person;
  //it also changes the original object
  captain.age = 75;
  console.log(person, captain);

  //The right way to make a copy of an object
  const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 70, number: 12});
  console.log(person, cap2);
  console.log(person, cap2);

  const cap3 = {...person};
  console.log("I'm a copy using spread...", cap3);

  //THINGS TO NOTE => THIS IS ONLY ONE LEVEL DEEP,
  //BOTH FOR ARRAYS AND OBJECTS

  // This doesn`t work:
  const Mia = {
    name: "Mia Lang",
    age: 34,
    social: {
      twitter: "Mia563",
      facebook: "MiaLang"
    },
  };

  const Lia = Object.assign({}, Mia);

  //This changes the original object
  Lia.social.twitter = "Lia543";
  console.log(Mia.social.twitter, Lia.social.twitter);
